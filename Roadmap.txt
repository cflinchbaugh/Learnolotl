Problem Being Solved:
    Creating, sorting, and shuffling flashcards becomes more complicated as the content continues to grow.

Application Goal:
    A quick and easy way to upload new content, filter content for focused study.  Renders the appropriate character-sets one at a time (in this case: Romanji/Hiragana/Katakana/Kanji).

1.0 Requirements
    Create entry-point
    Create mock-data
    Entry-point
        User selects desired "default" character-set for current "round"
    Create Content Organism:
        1) Render appropriate "selected" character-set (must support unicode characters)
        2) User exposes subsequent character-sets
        3) User must be able to cancel the "round"
