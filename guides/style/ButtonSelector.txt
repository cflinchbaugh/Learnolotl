Button Selector
    Functional Goals:
        Supports multiple options
        Selected option is indicated
        Un-selecting any/all options
        UX must be quick

    Style Goals:
        When inactive, selector is inobtrusive in order to avoid drawing attention from the learning objective
        When active, selector is prominent and adds flare to the application


    States:
        Inactive
        Active: Displaying Options
            Option is present but not Selected
            Option is actively being Selected
            Option is present and has been Selected
            
            Clear option is present but not selected
            Clear option is actively being Selected
            

    Notes:
        This is an area with potential to add a moment of delight but should not be excessive since it will potentially be interacted with multiple times per card.
