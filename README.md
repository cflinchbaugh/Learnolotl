# TL;DR
Learnolotl is a free *flashcard application* that lets you *read* and *create* cards with a potentially endless number of sides.<br/>

# Description
<a name="description"></a>
Whether you use cards someone else made or create your own, Learnolotl is for studying anything and everything, just like writing out traditional flash cards, but better because of two key reasons:<br/>

1. Learnolotl Cards Can Hold *Infinite* Answers
   + Real cards have two sides, but Learnolotl Cards can have an infinite number of sides, perfect for studying languages with their own character sets (see the in-app Japanese demo for a hands-on example).  Better yet, only one answer shows at a time- no more covering your notes to avoid seeing the answer too soon!

2. Learnolotl Cards Can Be Shared With Anyone
   + Learnolotl Cards are easy to create in the app and can be downloaded for easy sharing!  Because they're just files, a quick copy/paste lets you share your study materials with an entire class- no more trips to a photocopier!
